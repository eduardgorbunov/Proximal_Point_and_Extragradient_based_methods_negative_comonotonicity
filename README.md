Date:    October 2022

## Requirements

**Packages.** 
Jupyter notebooks and [PEPit](https://github.com/PerformanceEstimation/PEPit) (Performance Estimation in Python).

## Organization of the code

The code is divided in three parts:
- Worst-case examples and guarantees for Proximal Point method, see folder "Proximal_Point".
- PEPit codes for verifying numerically the results on Extragradient, see folder "Extragradient".
- PEPit codes for verifying numerically the results on Optimistic Gradient and additional symbolical verifications of the derivations from proofs of Lemma C.4 and Theorem C.6, see folder "Optimistic_Gradient".
